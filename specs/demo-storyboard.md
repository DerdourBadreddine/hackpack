# Hackpack 60s Demo Storyboard

**0:00 - 0:10 | Problem**
*   **Visual:** Fast montage of a developer struggling with terminal errors, "npm install" taking forever, and complex config files. Gray/Dark filter.
*   **Audio:** "The first 4 hours of every hackathon are wasted on setup. Boilerplate fatigue kills ideas before they start."

**0:10 - 0:20 | Introduction**
*   **Visual:** Screen clears to white. Hackpack Logo animates in (Apple style). The UI is clean, glassmorphic.
*   **Audio:** "Meet Hackpack. The bite-sized project generator for builders who want to ship."

**0:20 - 0:35 | The Flow**
*   **Visual:** Cursor clicks "Login with GitHub". Selects "Next.js Starter". Types "DreamProject". Clicks "Generate".
*   **Visual (Micro-interaction):** Show the loader, the log lines scrolling fast.
*   **Audio:** "Pick a stack. Name it. Generate. In seconds, Hackpack spins up a private repo, scaffolds the code, and configures deployment."

**0:35 - 0:50 | The Result**
*   **Visual:** "Success" screen with Confetti. Cursor clicks "Visit Live Site". A "Hello World" Next.js app opens in a new tab.
*   **Audio:** "You get a live URL, a clean repo, and a checklist of next steps automatically added as GitHub Issues."

**0:50 - 1:00 | Call to Action**
*   **Visual:** Zoom out to show the Dashboard. Text overlay: "Ship Faster."
*   **Audio:** "Stop configuring. Start coding. Build your next idea with Hackpack."
